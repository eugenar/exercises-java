QueryBuilder.java files:

Run with:

Considerations about creating a consumer application

The SODA API is heavily throttled. Currently, at only 1000 request/hour, it is not suitable
for supporting a large scale consumer application. For the particular "Food truck" use cases, the application
could use a middle tier which would cache the data per region, as the data is likely not 
changing often. One can use dedicated servers for different regions (based on the size of the data).
The cache should be refreshed at reasonable time intervals when traffic is light (e.g., every night).

The client app can also benefit from caching the last few queries (e.g., a common use case is to query
once per day before lunch).
